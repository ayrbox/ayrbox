      Right after my high-school I joined gapsco as a Programmer where I learn
      lots skills that I tresured. The team was incredible group of people.

      me be better communicator. Communication is vital as software developer
      has there is lot more human factor that computure and code. Object
      Oriented Programming (OOP), I first got a taste of OOP while working in
      gapsco. I did not realised that simple 1 hours tutorial would have that
      impact in entire career.
