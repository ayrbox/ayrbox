# Finally Off the list 

Finally, I have get ayrbox.com up and running. 

> Leap and the net will appear - By John Burroughs

## Background

In 2018, when I was working for Applied Blockchain, I aquired the domain and changed my github alias to ayrbox and 
everywhere I can. Back then, I working with `makevoid` and thats where I got the idea to use alias.

The name actually does not have any particular meaning but to let people know my brain is like a empty box with just
air in it. `airbox.com` was not available so I basically went with `ayrbox.com`.

## Objectives

I do not actually have any objectives with the site. I'm recovering awkward person when it comes to build a online 
profile. I panic when I am about put anything personal online. You could check my social media profile and it 
kind of reflect there too. Basically, what I want to say is I feel awkward sharing anything on my website.

However, when working as Software Engineer, I get issue all the time and quick googling help me direct to some articles 
or note that go on to save my whole day or entire week. Some engineers are really good and sharing golden nuggets online
which potientially help so many people.

And that is the objective that I look forward to achieve. Any new learning big or small that would geniunely interests 
me, I will try to capture it and share so that it might help at least a person and if not it would be an archive
for myself.


On top of that, I will also be priming myself to be bit open and share something. Thence, in future I would like to be
comfortable with recording and have a youtube channel someday.

## Conclusion

After years of procastination, I finally got this site up. It was not that I did not come up with excuses. Excuses that 
mind made was that I don't have enough content, I might need to up some analytics, I should first think of exact content
for theme and so on. I fought it hard to ignore the excuses and just got the site up.

I used vitepress to get the site up and everything completely out of box. In future I might do some modification but its a
problem for future myself.

For now I am in peace that I made the big leap of starting and finally get it off my to-do list.

Thank you for reading.
