# Big Bang Personality

As we live simple life there are instances where we come up with lots personality. 
A wide varitey of personality teaches us many thing. If we are interested and give more time in learning about the person and personality, it shifts our paradigm. I have learned that it helps to see things from different perspective and different angle.

On my journey, I came across people which are kind of arrogant in terms of knowledge. The are so ignorant about knowlege other people has achieved. I think such personality as big bang personality. Such person come across something new and goes telling everybody about new thing they learned. They are so loud and proud that intaking is so minimum. It might not be true for everybody but such person get offended if they are informed the information has been there since ages. I think they get virtually blind and thinks its a new discovery. They does see wide range of specturm but only tiny portion. Someone told me that is childish behaviour shown by other person as most young person are like that. They keep discovering things in life and at some point they ignore elder people as oracle but their own head (or probably google).


Recently, I learned to recognise the personality early on and learn to stay quite to avoid any argument.

As Preethi suggested on her blog post, those people starts to fall behind in healthy convesation as their knowlege are being challenged. The challange is taken as thread rather than paradigm shift.



**Most Recent Discovery of mine - Blackhole Personality**

As blackhole sucks in everything (even light) and does not emit out anything. People with such personality listen and never spit out a word. As a child I grew up as such person where I never had confident in speaking out. All processing goes into my brain only and if I gathered courage then I would mutter trembling. My paradigm shift was there in my teenage when I discovered importance of communication and realtion with other people.

Even with similar experience, I find it hard to understand people who does not speak out. I find it hard to reach out to them and understand. I am pretty sure I won't be able to change them instantly but I try to understand them.

Recently, I have confronted with such personality who are in thier adulthood and experienced they suck in all the light. They leave the atomosphere vacant and dark. The nod in agreement for everything you say; almost everything. Nothing is challenged until there comes responsibility. Again this might not be true for everybody but they lack total duedilgence and look for excuses or blames. To be honest, I completely lack the skill to handle such discussion when there is blame game and excuses not to take responsibilities of any sizes.

I have learnt to leave the muddy water untouched until it get cleared. I see it as experience as we grow older clears the way we see things. Clearing of muddy water is natural and it takes time. I learnt that both big bang and blackhole is muddy water and give enough time until it get clear on itself.
