## About

Hi, I am ayrbox* 

I am a software engineer/architect, hacker, technical leader, builder and naturally curious.

I have been working as software engineer since I left high school. That makes 24+ year
of experience coding and building software. I have been in and out in across differnt
industry. Current, I work in Lloyds Banking Group as Software Engineer.

I participate in full life cycle of a system. I engage with customer to learn about 
their experice. I specialise in Web UI, Backend and Security. 

Simple experience is a great experience.

If its a right thing then it has be easy because our brain
always choose easy by default. Thus making it simple is ultimate goal.
