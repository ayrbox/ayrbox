I love solving problems, helping others and being creative. I get to do all three as a software engineer. Writing software that automates or simplifies someone's work is magical. You have to be creative to tackle problems and produce elegant solutions. To be persistent with a problem, you have to love solving problems.

At my job, I advocate simple design that is reusable and well tested. I believe understanding domain knowledge and focusing on user experience (UX), developer experience (DX) is harder than writing coding. I have had opportunities to guide and help junior devs which I absolutely enjoyed.
